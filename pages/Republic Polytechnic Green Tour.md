Explore how environmentally sustainable initiatives and practices are integrated into the Republic Polytechnic’s (RP) campus. Exemplifying the fusion of nature and infrastructure, RP is a campus nestled within a park, embodying the principles of sustainable living and ecological equilibrium.&nbsp;

RP’s campus incorporates sustainable building elements such as solar panels installed on rooftops. The full wall windows strategically harness natural light while employing low-emittance glass and coatings to reduce heat transmission. A vertical green wall graces RP’s multi-storey carpark, adorned with climbing plants serving as bio-lungs, purifying the air.&nbsp;

Furthermore, embark on an enlightening journey through RP greenhouse, featuring a core building housing a naturally ventilated greenhouse, a climate-controlled glasshouse, and laboratories within containers designed for precise control of micro-climates. Various agricultural systems and remote monitoring technology facilitate the collection of vital physiological and environmental data.

Cultivate an appreciation for the interconnectedness of sustainability endeavours and our shared responsibility towards the planet with this tour.
