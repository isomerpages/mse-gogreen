Since 2021, ALBA has been collecting e-waste across the island for proper treatment and recycling. Appointed as the Producer Responsibility Scheme operator by NEA, the company is responsible for the collection and proper treatment of consumer e-waste on behalf of the producers. 

ALBA has deployed more than 550 e-waste recycling bins nationwide, at convenient locations such as community centres, supermarkets, electronics stores and government buildings - many of which you would have seen before. 

Travel to the heart of their operations at the ALBA E-Waste showroom and observe how the sorting processes are done.

Participants must be 12 years old and above. This facility is not accessible by wheelchair.
