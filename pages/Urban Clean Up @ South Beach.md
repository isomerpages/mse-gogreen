Participants will split into smaller groups and head out into areas surrounding South Beach, such as Suntec City, War Memorial Park and Raffles City. Cleanup activity takes 45 minutes to an hour, before ending with a debrief session hosted by Stridy. Tools will be provided. Children and families are welcome!
