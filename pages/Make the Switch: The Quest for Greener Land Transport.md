Our planet has been warming significantly, accelerating climate change. One of the main culprits is uncontrolled greenhouse gas emissions, much of which is created by human activity. This includes activities from the land transport sector.

Find out how you can reduce your carbon footprint and fight the climate crisis at the “Make the Switch: The Quest for Greener Land Transport” exhibition at the Singapore Mobility Gallery (SMG)!

Discover how small changes in our transport habits can make a huge difference in our fight against climate change. Complete a series of ‘quests’ to learn how Singapore’s land transport system is going green and make a pledge to do your part for a sustainable land transport future.

Explore the main Gallery too for a behind-the-scenes look at how LTA plans, designs and builds our land transport system while balancing efficiency, liveability and inclusivity as it leverages technology for smarter urban mobility.
