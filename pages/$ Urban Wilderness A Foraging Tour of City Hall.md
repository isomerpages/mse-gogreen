Calling all urban adventurers! Edible Garden City is hosting a foraging tour of two rooftop farms in the City Hall district – Raffles City Rooftop Farm and Funan Urban Farm.

Get up-close with nature at the Raffles City rooftop farm, which is usually not open to the public. Duck under Edible Garden City's lemon tree, smell the flowers and taste leaves straight off the trees. Finally, enjoy a short hands-on tea brewing session.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Next, make your way to the Funan Urban Farm, where you can indulge your senses in fragrant kaffir lime leaves and admire flowering plants. Participants can also enjoy a short potting activity and bring your new little plant home! &nbsp;

Participants will also receive two $5 vouchers to enjoy tasty treats from Tiong Bahru Bakery!&nbsp;

Please bring your own mug/drinking container for the tea brewing session&nbsp;and your own bag to take home your newly\-adopted plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This activity is recommended for participants aged 16 and above.
