A  used water superhighway for the future, the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) is a cost-efficient and sustainable solution conceived by Singapore's National Water Agency PUB to meet Singapore’s long-term needs for used water collection, treatment, reclamation, and disposal. DTSS uses deep tunnel sewers to convey used water by gravity to centralised water reclamation plants located at the coastal areas.  

Changi Water Reclamation Plant, at the heart of DTSS Phase 1, is a state-of-the-art facility capable of treating 900,000 cubic metres (202 million gallons) of used water per day to international standards. The treated used water is further purified into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water called NEWater or discharged to the sea through outfalls.

This tour is exclusively for Singapore citizens, permanent residents, and holders of ICA-approved and MOM-approved passes with a valid FIN number, including holders of employment pass, student pass, work permit, or dependent pass. 

Please note that this is strictly a bus tour and there will be no alighting from the bus along this tour.

This tour is only open to visitors who are 18 years old and above.
