Bring your old, used t-shirts and learn creative upcycling techniques to transform them into usable bags. You will also get to personalise your creation with fabric paints, stamps, and other decorations. Not only will you leave with a unique handmade bag for grocery shopping, but you will also be a part of the larger movement to reduce plastic waste and safeguard the environment.
