**Go Green with Grab by taking part in the Go Green Challenge!**

**Date:** Until 16 July<br>
**Organiser:** Grabcar Pte Ltd

Grab will be organising a Go Green Challenge from 12 June to 16 July to raise awareness of the green features for its transport and delivery services and encourage the adoption of eco-friendly practices among consumers.

The Go Green Challenge requires consumers to toggle on the Eco-friendly rides<sup>1</sup> and Green Programme<sup>2</sup> when they are taking rides or ordering delivery services. Upon completion of the challenge, consumers will stand a chance to win attractive prizes such as eco-friendly staycations and F&amp;B vouchers.

<sup>1</sup>Eco-friendly rides is a feature for consumers to prioritise cleaner-energy vehicles over petrol vehicles when booking a JustGrab ride, with no additional cost.

<sup>2</sup>Green Programme is a voluntary contribution that goes towards purchasing carbon credits and solarising community institutions in Singapore. By opting in, there will be an additional S$0.10 charge for each ride and GrabFood or GrabMart delivery order you make.
