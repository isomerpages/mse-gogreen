In a fun and interactive talk by online vegan grocer GoodFoodPeople, its accredited nutritionist will explain what a plant-based diet is, and its associated health and environmental benefits. 

Learn where to find essential nutrients, and the pros and cons of plant-based protein products. Participants will have the opportunity to sample some plant-based meat alternatives and enjoy their very own vegan bowl after the talk. 

This is a great opportunity to understand the need to start thinking about the choice of food, and how diet impacts health and the planet.

Join this talk if you care about eating health, for yourself and for the world we live in.
