**Singapore could very well have to adapt to new modes of transport in the future due to climate change. 
Reimagine and build your own sustainable transportation in this workshop!**

**Admission:** Free<br>

**Organiser:** ArtScience Museum, Marina Bay Sands


Due to climate change and rising sea levels, we may have to adapt to very different modes of transport in cities in the future. Imagine and build your own sustainable transport in this drop-in activity!

If roads and highways are flooded, how do we navigate our way through? What kind of transportation will we see? How do we make transport more sustainable?

Materials will be provided for this drop-in activity. This drop-in session is offered as part of Marina Bay Sands' education programme in support of Go Green SG.
