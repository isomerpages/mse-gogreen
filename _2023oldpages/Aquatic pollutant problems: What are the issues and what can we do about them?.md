Water quality issues like harmful algal blooms, eutrophication and pollution are affecting marine and freshwater environments. Understanding the role of plankton in aquatic ecosystems is the key to advancing solutions for our water resource challenges.

In this talk, Dr Mowe, a biology lecturer at the National University of Singapore with more than 10 years of research experience in hytoplankton and zooplankton ecology, will highlight some of the most pressing aquatic pollutant problems and what can be done to overcome them. You can also expect to gain insights from interesting global case studies.

Come find out more about aquatic pollution, how we are affected by these issues and what we can do about them!
