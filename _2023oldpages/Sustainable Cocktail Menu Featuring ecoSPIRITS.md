**Raise a toast to positive impact with The Urban Decay and Carbon Eclipse, concocted by Head Mixologist Daniel Anthony using EcoSpirits and infused with upcycled herbs and fruit waste.**

**Date:** 1 - 31 July<br>
**Venue:** LeBar, Sofitel Singapore Sentosa<br>
**Organiser:** Sentosa Development Corporation

LeBar will be incorporating spirits packaged using the ecoSPIRITS system in their in-house cocktails. 

ecoSPIRITS is an innovative closed-loop distribution system that nearly eliminates packaging waste in the premium spirits supply chain. By dramatically reducing packaging and transport costs, ecoSPIRITS provides a low carbon and low waste spirits distribution system, thereby reducing carbon footprint.

In July, LeBar will feature two sustainable cocktails concocted by Head Mixologist, Daniel Anthony. The featured cocktails (priced at $20++ per glass) will include components made from upcycled herbs and fruit waste.

* The Urban Decay: Jackfruit seed infused gin, orange skin and black lemons

* Carbon Eclipse: Rosemary stem tequila, sauteed pineapple core, mango juice, egg white

Guests may also scan a QR code on the menu card and discover the “Sofitel Singapore Sentosa Forest”, in which they can find out more about the impact of Sofitel’s environmental efforts.
