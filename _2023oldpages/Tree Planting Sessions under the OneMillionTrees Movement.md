Venue: Various tree planting locations<br>
Organiser: National Parks Board

The OneMillionTrees movement is a nationwide effort to plant a million more trees across Singapore between 2020 and 2030. 2023 marks 60 years of greening Singapore since founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew launched our first nationwide tree-planting campaign in 1963 by planting a Mempat tree at Farrer Circus. 

Join us in our tree planting efforts in Singapore’s streetscapes, gardens, parks and park connectors, nature reserves and nature parks. Together, we can transform Singapore into a City in Nature for future generations to enjoy!
