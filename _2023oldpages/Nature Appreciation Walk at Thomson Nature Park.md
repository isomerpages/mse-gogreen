Located to the east of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, between Old Upper Thomson Road and Upper Thomson Road, Thomson Nature Park acts as a green buffer to the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. 

This 50-hectare buffer park is unique for its rich cultural heritage as the site of a former Hainan Village. 

It is also home to a rich array of biodiversity and is notably a key conservation site for the critically endangered Raffles’ Banded Langur (*Presbytis femoralis femoralis*). 
 
Through this guided walk, visitors will gain a greater appreciation of Singapore’s rich natural heritage and understand the need to protect it.
