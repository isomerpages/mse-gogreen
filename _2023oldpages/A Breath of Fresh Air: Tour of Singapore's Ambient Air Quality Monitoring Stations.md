Did you know that the ambient air quality (quality of outdoor air in our surrounding environment) in Singapore is continuously monitored through a network of air monitoring sensors across Singapore? These sensors track the level of six key air pollutants, which are used to compute the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) over a rolling 24-hour period.

Find out how ambient air quality is being monitored in stations through this tour. Participants will get to view real-time data, learn about pollutant sources, data collection and more!

Participants must be 13 years old and above. This facility is not accessible by wheelchair. Participants must wear covered shoes.
