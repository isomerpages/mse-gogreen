Freshwater forest streams are considered rare habitats in Singapore. 

They provide a great many ecosystem services that are not easily replaced by man-made longkangs (i.e., drains). They house a high percentage of Singapore’s biodiversity, including over 30 species of freshwater fish and over 10 species of crabs and shrimp. 

On the walk, you would be led on a guided exploration to learn stream ecology and identification. It is an incredibly therapeutic and relaxing experience to tread through a natural stream surrounded by fronds.
