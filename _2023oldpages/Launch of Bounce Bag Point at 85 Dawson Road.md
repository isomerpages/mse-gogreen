**Contribute or take a reusable bag from the new Bounce Bag Point at Dawson Road and help reduce the use of plastic bags.**

**Date:** 20 July, 4:30 - 5:30pm <br>
**Venue:** 85 Dawson Road<br>
**Organiser:** Tanjong Pagar Town Council 

Bounce Bag Point is a community initiative by Tanjong Pagar Town Council (TPTC) to share reusable bags. 
  
To encourage shoppers to adopt more sustainable habits such as bringing their own bags and reducing the use of disposable and plastic bags, TPTC is working with Plastic Lite SG to install Bounce Bag Points at strategic locations in the estate. Members of the public can give or take a free bag from the Bounce Bag Point. 
  
TPTC will launch a new Bounce Bag Point at Blk 85 Dawson Road (outside Sheng Siong supermarket) in support of Go Green SG.
