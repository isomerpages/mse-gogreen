From the salt lakes of the savannah to the Arctic Circle, from the rainforest canopy to the depths of the earth and oceans, become explorers as you embark on a larger-than-life journey through seven natural environments. Guided by your senses and curiosity, you we will encounter a variety of species during this extraordinary expedition. See, hear, smell and feel nature like never before!

This one-of-a-kind exhibition presents strikingly real, high-definition videos filmed at different locations around the planet. Specially designed scents and sound effects bring you closer to the living world.

Organised by ArtScience Museum and BASE Entertainment Asia, this exhibition was created by Sensory Odyssey Studio in collaboration with the French National Museum of Natural History in Paris. The 2023 Asian premiere of this exhibition at ArtScience Museum marks the first stop of it's global tour.
